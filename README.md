# RectangleDetection
Step by Step detection of rectangles in an image (2D shapes -> realistic street image -> live camera feed). 
</br> 

## Current Methodology 
1. Read in image (resize if necesssary)
2. Convert image to grayscale 
3. Gaussian blur and threshold the image
4. TBD (testing finding contours vs. Canny edge detection)

## Goal 
Detect street signs and extracting text from within. 
This repo will aid in creating an MVP of my CV+GPS personal project.
